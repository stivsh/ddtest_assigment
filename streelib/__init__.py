"""This is "The Simple Tree Lib".
The Simple Tree Lib" provides Tree and Node structures and just one alg
DFS traversal.
Cause this all was done just for as a test work for the job application.

This script takes a file with a tree data and outputs all ways in this tree.
File is simple text file, with lines like this:
A->B;
B->C;
Where A,B and C are Nodes in an input tree and A->B indicates that
there is an edge from A to B.

Usage:
    waysintree <file_name> [ --delimiter DELIMETER ]

Options:
  -h --help     show this help message and exit
  --delimiter   delimiter between nodes in a way
